## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.7 or later**
2. Required Python libraries:
   - `tkinter` (for GUI creation)
   - `subprocess` (for running external scripts)
   - `tkinter.messagebox` (for popup notifications)

## 📂 Folder Structure

Here’s the structure of the project files:
```
Ultimate-Feature-Launcher/
├── main.py               # Main application script
├── Gemini_OCR_SDK.py     # Script for Enhanced OCR (ensure this file exists)
├── simpleocr.py          # Script for Simple OCR
├── de.py                 # Script for PDF to Audiobook
├── pdftrans.py           # Script for PDF Translation
├── README.md             # Project documentation
```

Place the required scripts (`Gemini_OCR_SDK.py`, `simpleocr.py`, `de.py`, `pdftrans.py`) in the same directory as `main.py` for seamless integration.
